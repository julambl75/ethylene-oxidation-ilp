# Format

## Static

The 'static/' directory contains all of the rules generated by T_static.

## Dynamic (+ Cost Opt)

The 'dynamic/' and 'cost_opt_dynamic/' directories contain the results from running T_dynamic, with and without the focus on sensor cost. The results are organized in separate sub-directories according to when they were run: each one contains a file called 'args.txt' which can be used to find out what learning parameters were used (see 'database/generate_task.py'). One exception is 'cost_opt_dynamic/embedded.

'cost_opt_dynamic/embedded/' contains the results from T_dynamic_opt, organized according to the bias constraints added.

### Miscellaneous

When `cd`ed into a results directory (i.e., containing an 'args.txt'), these commands can be used for results from vanilla FastLAS (i.e., non-probabilistic) for computing accuracy metrics by averaging the value over the failure classes:
- `cat metrics.txt | grep Accuracy | sed 's/.*: //' | awk '{ total += $1; count++ } END { print total/count }' | awk '{printf("%.2f\n", $0)}'`
- `cat metrics.txt | grep F1 | sed 's/.*: //' | awk '{ total += $1; count++ } END { print total/count }' | awk '{printf("%.2f\n", $0)}'`
